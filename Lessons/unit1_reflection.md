# Unit 1 Reflection

1. What worked well during unit 1?
Experimenting and working with github. Snakify, learning basic python coding functions and learning the fundamentals of computer science. Organizing all of my work, undertanding and retaining knowledge and applying them. 

2. What did not work well?
At first I was very confused about what do to, and I did not understand coding and drawing diagrams very much. Though overtime in Unit 1, after studying and having 1 on 1 sessions with Dr. Ruben, I understood them much better. Not only did I gain a greater understanding I also gained more interest in Computer Science.

3. What did you enjoy the most during project unit 1
I think I enjoyed the unit project the most. That is because I got to experiment with different functions and coding techniques. I could have fun being creative within my project, while also learning more about Python and coding.

4. What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
I practived my organization and my memory abilities during this unit. Since I had spent much more time working on Computer Science, I had to plan accordingly to make sure I also complete the work for all of my other classes. I also practiced retaining knowledge learned in class and applying it to the assignments, quizzes, and project.

5. What is working well in Computer Science for you?
Organizing all of my work and completing it on time. Also understanding the concepts and applying them to the assignemnts given. For example, drawing/designing the different diagrams and coding.
 
6. What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
I think providing more instructions and making more interactive class assignments/discussions will be beneficial. I think that when students work together they can learn from each other as well as from the teacher. More small assignments outside of class can also help us practice what we learn in class.

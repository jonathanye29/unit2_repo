## 1. What are some words that come to your mind when thinking about your process/results of unit 2?
Time management, teamwork, and communication. 

## 2. What did you learn?
I learned how to communicate effectively with my partner to complete this project. I also learned many different interesting facts when plotting graphs, and learned how to use a Raspberry Pi. 

## 3. What were the challenges of the Project/Teamwork?
Some challenges were that my teammate and I did not live in the same house. We had to communicate online and only one of us could have the physical Raspberry PI at a time. However, I learned to effectively communicate and organize well with my teammate to complete the project.

## 4. In comparison to Unit 1, what did you do different, what was better?
In comparison to Unit 1, I went into this project with a lot less fear. I had more confidence in me and my teammate that we would accomplish this project together and make something great. Compared to Unit 1, I definitely could have organized my time better with the project. However, it was much better that Unit 1 because I felt more comfortable with GitHub and the documentation aspect of the project.

## 5. What are your next goals? Unit 3/4
My goals for Unit 3/4 are to continue to grasp the understanding of each topic taught, so when it comes to the project, I feel confident in my understanding to complete the task. My goal is to dedicate more time into computer science, as it gets more and more interesting as I continue to learn it.
